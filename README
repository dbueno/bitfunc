* Dependencies

  - autoconf
  - automake
  - autoconf-archive (on some systems)
  - pkg-config
  - libtool
  - Cython >= 0.15
  - gcc (we use a bunch of its optimizations)
  - picosat-936 (optional, but strongly recommended): http://fmv.jku.at/picosat/picosat-936.tar.gz

If you want to _hack_ on bitfunc, then you need a few more things:

  - Don Knuth's CWEB. funcsat, a SAT solver bundled with bitfunc, uses CWEB.

* Installation

First, untar picosat and compile it with ./configure && make.

curl -O http://fmv.jku.at/picosat/picosat-936.tar.gz
tar xzf picosat-936.tar.gz
cd picosat-936 && ./configure && make

Next, compile bitfunc:

./configure --prefix=/path/to/somewhere --with-picosat=/path/to/picosat-936
make 
make install

* Python API

Assuming you have Python 2.7-ish with the dev stuff installed, after
installation to $DIR, add $DIR/lib/python2.7/site-packages to $PYTHONPATH. To
test, you should be able to do:

    python -c 'import bitfunc'

without problems.
