** TODO picosat incremental doesn't work. why not?

** CANCELLED add ABC instead of aiger.c
   - State "CANCELLED"  from "TODO"       [2012-05-25 Fri 08:25] \\
     I added ABC.

** CANCELLED decouple underlying AIG from literals in bitfunc
  - State "CANCELLED"  from "TODO"       [2012-05-25 Fri 08:26] \\
    I'm not doing this in C until I've prototyped an abstraction mechanism in python.
this might be sort of already done because of the literal datatype and
lit_bf2aiger and litAIG2CNF. eventually I want to be able to do word-level
solving/simplification inside bitfunc before passing to the solver. or even
abstraction.

** TODO implement the concrete emulation
whenever all the arguments are concrete to +, call the machine +
** TODO remove calls to funcsat functions (like resize) if you're
not using funcsat in bitfunc
** TODO check for llvm-py during configure step and enable if there

* llvm frontend
** TODO implement llvm symex for popcnt_x86
